    <h1>Hello (fallback)</h1>
    <p>This app was generated as a fallback because AI Pipe failed. Brief: Publish a Bootstrap page with form id="github-user-" that fetches a GitHub username, optionally uses ?token=, and displays the account creation date in YYYY-MM-DD UTC inside #github-created-at.</p>
